# Air_quality_Guatemala
This project was made with the purpose of creating different scripts for air quality in Guatemala. These scripts can be changed to fulfill the purpose of the research, this means that you can chance either the imagery dates, bands or other parameters. 

*Note. This is one of my first scripts, so there can be any error that can change the resulting data for analysis.
